What is front controller pattern?

The front controller design pattern means that all requests that come for a resource in an application will be handled by a single handler and then dispatched to the appropriate handler for that type of request. The front controller may use other helpers to achieve the dispatching mechanism.

Advantages of Front controller pattern:
Centralized control : Front controller handles all the requests to the Web application. This implementation of centralized control that avoids using multiple controllers is desirable for enforcing application-wide policies such as users tracking and security.
Thread-safety : A new command object arises when receiving a new request and the command objects are not meant to be thread-safe. Thus, it will be safe in the command classes. Though safety is not guaranteed when threading issues are gathered, codes that act with the command are still thread safe.

Disadvantages of Front controller pattern:
It is not possible to scale an application using a front controller.
Performance is better if you deal with a single request uniquely.

Components of Front controller pattern:

Front Controller - Single handler for all kinds of requests coming to the application (either web based/ desktop based).

Dispatcher - Front Controller may use a dispatcher object which can dispatch the request to corresponding specific handler.

View - Views are the object for which the requests are made.
